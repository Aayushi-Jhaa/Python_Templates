# Templates
When I work with coding templates in Python machine learning, I leverage these pre-built structures to streamline the development process. 
By utilizing templates, I can quickly set up the necessary components, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, without having to write everything from scratch. These templates encapsulate best practices and design patterns, enabling me to focus on customizing the model architecture and fine-tuning hyperparameters for specific tasks.

Overall, coding templates serve as a valuable resource in Python machine learning by promoting code reuse, reducing development time, and ensuring consistency across projects. They enable me to expedite the implementation of machine learning models and foster efficient experimentation and iteration to achieve optimal results.
